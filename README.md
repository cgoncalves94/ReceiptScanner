# Receipt Scanner

A modern Python API template showcasing the integration of FastAPI, SQLModel, async database operations, Pydantic, and Pydantic AI. While implemented as a receipt scanner, this project serves as a reference architecture for building robust APIs with these technologies.

## Technical Overview

This project demonstrates the powerful combination of:

- **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **SQLModel**: Unified model system combining SQLAlchemy and Pydantic for type-safe ORM
- **Async Database Operations**: Full async/await pattern for database interactions
- **Pydantic**: Type validation and settings management
- **Pydantic AI**: Structured AI response handling with Gemini Vision integration

The project also implements:

- Domain-driven design organization
- Dependency injection pattern
- Comprehensive error handling
- Docker containerization
